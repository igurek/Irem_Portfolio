# Irem_Portfolio
Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository showcases my data science projects, highlighting my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. 


[Project 1: Waiter Tip Prediction] (https://github.com/igurek/Tip-Prediction/blob/main/Waiter%20Tips%20Prediction-UPDATED%20PROJECT.py) 
This project focuses on predicting the amount of tip a waitress is likely to receive based on certain factors such as the total bill, the day of the week, and the time of day. The dataset was obtained from a restaurant and contains over 200 entries. The project includes data cleaning techniques such as imputation and removal of outliers as well as data visualization using tools such as matplotlib and seaborn. The analysis was carried out in Jupyter Notebook using Python. This project allowed me to improve my data visualization and analysis skills while overcoming the challenges of working with incomplete and messy data.


[Project 2: Retail Sales Analysis Project] (https://github.com/igurek/SQL_Sales_project) 
This project aims to showcase my SQL skills by analyzing and extracting valuable insights from a dataset of retail sales records. By delving into the data, I address critical business questions and provide comprehensive analysis for stakeholders.

Business Questions: The study focuses on answering important business questions related to retail sales, such as identifying top-selling products, analyzing sales trends over time, understanding customer behavior, and evaluating store performance.

SQL Expertise: I leverage my SQL skills to perform data extraction, transformation, and analysis tasks, showcasing my proficiency in utilizing SQL queries to derive meaningful insights.
