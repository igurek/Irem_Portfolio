 This repository showcases my data projects, highlighting my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. 

## [Project 1: Black Friday Sales Analysis Project] (https://github.com/igurek/Black-Friday-Sales) 
This project aims to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. After creating valuable insights from the data, now I started to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products. Modeling part will be updated.
